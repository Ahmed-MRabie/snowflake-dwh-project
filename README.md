# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake Data Warehouse Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates **complete Data Warehouse on Snowflake with a full end-to-end ETL/ELT pipeline**, using real-world modeling concepts like **Snowflake Schema** and **SCD Type 2** for tracking historical changes

### üéØ Business Scenario:
We simulate a retail sales scenario, collecting data from:
- Sales transactions
- Customers and products metadata

The final goal is to transform this raw data into a well-structured analytical model for reporting and historical tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Tool/Technology     | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Snowflake           | Data warehouse + staging + transformation   |
| SQL                 | Data modeling, cleansing, and ETL/ELT logic |
| Streams & Tasks     | Automating Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD2)|

## üîÅ Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Generation**  
   - Two main CSV files: `sales.csv` and `products_customers.csv`

2. **Data Staging**  
   - Upload CSVs into an internal Snowflake stage

3. **Raw Table Creation**  
   - Load data into raw staging tables using `COPY INTO`

4. **Transformation Logic**  
   - Populate cleaned `dim` and `fact` tables with surrogate keys

5. **SCD Type 2 Implementation**  
   - Streams track changes in dimension tables
   - Tasks automate versioning logic with `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_current`

## ‚≠ê Snowflake Schema Overview

- `FACT_SALES` connects to:
  - `DIM_PRODUCT` (with surrogate key and SCD logic)
  - `DIM_CUSTOMER` (with full profile and tracking)
  - `DIM_CATEGORY` (linked to `DIM_PRODUCT`)

- Historical tracking ensures we capture all dimension changes over time

---

## üìä Final Outcome

By the end of the pipeline, we have:
- A Snowflake schema with clean, historical, and trackable data
- Automated SCD Type 2 processing
- A scalable data warehouse model ready for reporting and analytics

This simulates a real-world enterprise scenario with change tracking and data integrity at the core.
